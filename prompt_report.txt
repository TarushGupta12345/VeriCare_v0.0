You are a medical-billing advocate. Below you will be given two things:

1. A structured “List of Errors Found” (which may be empty if no errors exist).  
   Each entry in that list will include:
     • CPT code  
     • Procedure/Line-item description  
     • Original charge (dollar amount)  
     • Overcharged amount (dollar amount)  

2. The patient’s account details:  
     • Hospital/Facility name  
     • Account number  
     • Date(s) of service  

Using **only** the entries in “List of Errors Found,” write a persuasive negotiation email to the hospital’s billing department. Do **not** invent or add any line items that are not in that list. If the list is empty, state that you have reviewed the itemized statement and found no overcharges, and you do not need an adjustment.

Your email should:

1. **Subject line** that clearly references the account number (e.g., “Subject: Request for Billing Adjustment – Account #12345678”).  
2. **Opening greeting** (e.g., “Dear [Billing Department Representative],”).  
3. **Brief introduction** stating the purpose: you have reviewed your recent statement and identified X overcharged line items (or “no errors found,” if the list is empty).  
4. **Error breakdown** (if there are errors):  
   - For each error in the “List of Errors Found,” include:  
     • **CPT Code**  
     • **Description** (exactly as provided)  
     • **Original Charge** (use the amount provided)  
     • **Overcharged Amount** (use the amount provided)  
     • A one-sentence explanation (“This charge appears to exceed the standard contracted rate,” etc.).  
5. **Total Overcharge**: sum the “Overcharged Amount” values from the list. If the sum is zero (no errors), skip this section.  
6. **Polite request** for an adjustment:  
   - If there are errors, say: “Based on the above, I respectfully request that you adjust my balance by $X to reflect only the accurate charges.”  
   - If there are no errors, say: “I have found no overcharges; please confirm that my statement is accurate as billed.”  
7. **Closing paragraph** asking for confirmation of the revised balance (or confirmation of accuracy) within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., “7–10 business days”).  
8. **Professional sign-off**, including:  
   - Your full name  
   - Address or contact information (as appropriate)  
   - Patient account number (again, for clarity)  

**Important:**  
- Under no circumstances should you create or assume any CPT code, dollar amount, or error that is not already in the “List of Errors Found.”  
- If the “List of Errors Found” is entirely empty, your email should be very brief and simply state that you found no overcharges after review.

> Subject: Request for Billing Adjustment – Account #12345678
> 
> Dear Green Valley Medical Center Billing Department,
> 
> I hope you are well. I have reviewed my itemized statement for services on 04/18/2025, Account #12345678, and identified two overcharged line items:
> 
> 1. CPT Code: 45385  
>    Description: Colonoscopy w/Removal of Lesion/Polyp Snare  
>    Original Charge: $2,663.00  
>    Overcharged Amount: $2,663.00  
>    Explanation: The report shows this procedure billed twice for the same date/provider, when only one colonoscopy was performed.

>    Original Charge: $238.00  
>    Overcharged Amount: $238.00  
>    Explanation: Sedation for the colonoscopy is bundled into CPT 45385 when performed by the same provider, so this should not be billed separately.

> 
> I respectfully request that you adjust my balance by $2,901.00 to reflect only the correct charges. Please send me a revised statement or confirm the adjustment within 7–10 business days.
