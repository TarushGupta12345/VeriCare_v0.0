Given the provided bill, your job is to:
## 1. Extract Billing Codes.
- Identify every billing code on the bill. This includes:  
  - **CPT** (5-digit numeric)  
  - **HCPCS** (alphanumeric, typically starting with a letter)  
  - **ADA** (dental codes, e.g. D####)  
  - **UB-04 revenue codes** (4-digit numeric)  
  - Any other recognized procedure/service code sets THAT ARE NOT INSURANCE RELATED (usually 99xxxxxx, 97xxxxxx, etc.).  
- Alongside each code, copy the exact description text from the bill.  
- If no billing codes are present, reply “None found” and stop generating.  
-DO NOT GENERATE A TABLE OR DASHES: Instead, create a list of bullet points.

**Focus only on billing codes** (e.g. CPT, HCPCS, ADA, UB-04 revenue codes, etc.). Do **not** attempt to interpret or audit insurance/payment codes (e.g., lines beginning with “99…” or othher insurer adjustments). If a code is clearly an insurance/payment or adjustment code, skip it.  

Your final return value should be the code format name, ":", and a list of each of the codes, seperated by a comma and a space. For instance:
"CPT: 45385, 99512, 45835, 88305"
