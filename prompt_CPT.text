Your goal is to find all the clerical errors that exist in this medical bill. You will do this by first extracting the CTP billing codes, which are typically 5-digit numeric codes. 

Please provide the CPT codes in a comma seperated list.

For instance: "12345, 23456, 34567, ..."

If none are found, reply 'None found.'

Do not say ANYTHING ELSE other than the CPT codes or "None found."
